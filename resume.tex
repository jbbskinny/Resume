\section{Summary}
Specific experience in organizing, problem solving, and communicating status, progress and timely
completion of assigned projects; demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines;
adapts readily to new challenges; grasps and applies new procedures quickly; highly-motivated,
detail-oriented team player.

\section{Objective} 
To obtain an entry-level position as a software engineer where my computational and
problem solving skills combined with a strong mathematical background will be applied.

\section{Education} 
B.S. in Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, May 2013 \\
GPA 3.7 in major, 3.1 overall

\section{Work \\Experience}
 {\bf Graduate Teaching Assistant,} Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA \\  Fall 2013 - May 2015
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Taught Physics I and Physics II labs; received high remarks from most students in previous semesters
 \item Mentor and tutor students enrolled in Physics I and II in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons
 \item Proctor and grade exams
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Intern,} AnswerRocket, Atlanta, GA \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Automated a client-side QA daemon using Python, Bash and JSON
 \item Would query the AnswerRocket server when code was pushed to the Git repository
       and pinpoint any coding errors or dependency issues if a test failed
 \item More comprehensive tests could be ran on a timer throughout the day and night
       and email team members the status on completion
 \item Verbosity of error reports were an issue on client-side; suggested
       metadata of detailed error reports sent to my automator's IP
 \end{itemize}


\section{Research}
 {\bf Student Researcher,} Naval Research Lab, Washington, D.C. \hfill Summer  2013
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Used the Long Wavelength Array 1 (LWA-1) in New Mexico to observe 
       approximately 80 pulsars remotely
 \item Pulsar search and initial analysis done by PRESTO (written in C),
       further analysis performed by Python scripts/programs
 \item Studied pulse broadening in pulsar B0950+08, allowing us to approximate 
       the sensitivity of LWA-1
 \item Reference: \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7422}
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Undergraduate Researcher,} Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, Atlanta, GA \\  
                                                              Fall 2012 - Spring 2013
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
 \item Built a computational model of radiative transfer in neutron star atmospheres 
 \item The front-end is written in Python and heavy calculations were done in C
 \item Used Vim for editing code
 \item SCons used to build the program; Bitbucket used for a versioning system; 
       Doxygen used to document the program
 \item Coding style based off the paper ``Best Practices for Scientific Computing''
 \item Public Repository: \url{https://github.com/jbbskinny/NSatmo}
 \end{itemize}
