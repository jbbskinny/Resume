\section{Summary}
Specific experience in organizing, problem solving, and communicating status, progress and timely
completion of assigned projects; demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines;
adapts readily to new challenges; grasps and applies new procedures quickly; highly-motivated,
detail-oriented team player.

\section{Objective} 
To obtain an entry-level position as a software engineer where my computational and
problem solving skills combined with a strong mathematical background will be applied.

\section{Education} 
B.S. in Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, May 2013 \\
GPA 3.7 in major, 3.1 overall

\section{Work \\Experience}
 {\bf Graduate Teaching Assistant,} Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA \\  Fall 2013 - May 2015
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Taught Physics I and Physics II labs; received high remarks from most students in previous semesters
 \item Mentor and tutor students enrolled in Physics I and II in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons
 \item Proctor and grade exams
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Intern,} AnswerRocket, Atlanta, GA \hfill Summer 2014
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Project initiated to design and implement a Python-based automated regression model
 \item Program design was to pull from the Git server when a new version of the code was uploaded; if errors
       detected, an email would be sent to the quality control supervisor
 \item Studies of results over time indicated the program should have
       been implemented server-side allowing submission of accurate error reports
 \end{itemize}


\section{Research}
 {\bf Student Researcher,} Naval Research Lab, Washington, D.C. \hfill Summer  2013
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Used the Long Wavelength Array 1 (LWA-1) in New Mexico to observe 
       approximately 80 pulsars remotely
 \item Studied pulse broadening in pulsar B0950+08, allowing us to approximate 
       the sensitivity of LWA-1
 \item Pulsar search and initial analysis was done by PRESTO (written in C); 
       further analysis was done in Python
 \item Reference: \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7422}
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Undergraduate Researcher,} Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, Atlanta, GA \\  Fall 2012 - Spring 2013
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
 \item Built a computational model of radiative transfer in neutron star atmospheres assuming local thermodynamic
       and radiative equilibrium
 \item The front-end was written in Python and the heavy calculations were carried out in C 
       functions for speed
 \item Coding style based off the paper ``Best Practices for Scientific Computing''
 \item SCons used to build the program; Bitbucket used for a versioning system; Doxygen used to document the program
 \item Less than one percent convergence achieved with proper boundary conditions
 \end{itemize}
